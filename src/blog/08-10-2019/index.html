                <p>
                    It's been more than a month since I released my game on steam, and although it didn't 
                    do well, it's been a great learning experience. It allowed me to get my feet wet in the world of Steam.

                            While playing steam games I don't give much attention to achievements. After I released my game on steam 
                            however, and added my own achievements, I noticed something useful about them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a game's store page all of the achievements for that game are listed. If you click on the 
                            "view all" you get an overview of all the achievements for that game and how well players
                            are doing at unlocking them.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class='image-section'>
                        {{>image-with-caption
                            imgSrc='/assets/blog/08-10-2019/Viewing-achievements.png'
                            captionText="View all achievements from the store page"
                        }}
                    </div>

                <p>
                    The image in the following section shows the achievements for my own game. The percentage
                    denotes the proportion of players that have both launched the game and unlocked
                    the given achievement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Interpreting the data
                </h2>
                
                <div class='text-image-group'>
                        <div class='text-section'>
                        <p>
                            The first thing you might notice is that the percentage for "Start a new game" is quite low - only 66.5% 
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            If someone goes to the trouble of downloading and running the game, you would at least expect them to play it!
                            The only reasonable explanation is that these players are experiencing crashes upon loading into a level. 
                            I decided to only support Windows 10 and didn't test on any other OS, so this is not too surprising.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Secondly, there are quite a few players that have unlocked <strong>ALL</strong> achievements, and it's the same unlock rate for each.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Suspicious... &#129300;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm quite sure that this is a group that cheated the game, to "harvest" the achievements. I'm certain because
                            this percentage has remained static since about 1 or 2 days after the game was released. Also, it would be almost
                            impossible to unlock them all in just 2 days - the game is quite long, and the bonus collectibles are hard to get,
                            let alone find.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So people cheated - but it's not a big deal. They can enjoy the game however they like. But it might be a good idea
                            to factor this into our analysis.
                        </p>

                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I realised that my game is too damn hard!
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we remove both those that cheated and those who couldn't run the game from the stats, we end up with the following:
                </p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <th>Achievement unlocked</th>
                        <th>% of players</th>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Start a new game</td>
                            <td>100%</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Start level 7</td>
                            <td>2.4%</td>

                            <td>0.32%</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Start level 19</td>
                            <td>0.48%</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Finish the game</td>
                            <td>0%</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>
                    Welp, looks like my game was way too hard (or doesn't seem worth trying) for most players.
                    For my next game I'll make sure to get a variety of players to test it to ensure it's balanced, as it seems
                    I've wasted a lot of time in making the later levels.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    There's a lot of insights you can gain from achievements if you put them in interesting places throughout your game.
                    From how players are progressing in the game to how much a certain feature is used; there's a lot of room
                    for analysis. And they're super easy to add to your game to boot!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So next time you release a game on steam, make sure to think about how you can gain insights from your
                    achievements after launch. But make sure not to add in dozens of achievements just for the sake of
                    analytics. They should still feel like achievements to the player.
