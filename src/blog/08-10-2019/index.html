                <p>
                    It's been more than a month since I released my game on steam, and although it didn't 
                    do well, it's been a great learning experience. It was only a free game anyway; to get my feet wet in the world of Steam.

                            While playing steam games I don't give much heed to achievements. When I released my game on steam 
                            however, I noticed something useful.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a game's store page all of the achievements for that game are listed. If you click on the 
                            "view all" you get an overview of all the achievements for that game and how well players
                            are doing at unlocking them.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class='image-section'>
                        {{>image-with-caption
                            imgSrc='/assets/blog/08-10-2019/Viewing-achievements.png'
                            captionText="View all achievements from the store page"
                        }}
                    </div>
                    
                </div>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    The image in the following section shows the achievements for my own game. The percentage
                    denotes the proportion of players that have both launched the game and unlocked
                    the given achievement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Interpreting the data
                </h2>
                
                <div class='text-image-group'>
                        <div class='text-section'>
                        <p>
                            The first thing you might notice is that the percentage for "Start a new game" is quite low - only 66.5% 
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            If someone goes to the trouble of downloading and running the game, you would at least expect them to play it!
                            It only makes sense that these players are experiencing crashes upon loading into a level. I didn't have many
                            devices to test with so I made a choice to only support Windows 10. Also it was a really old game I had abandoned,
                            and I just wanted to get it done. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Secondly, there are quite a few players that have unlocked ALL achievements, and it's the same unlock rate for each.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Suspicious... ðŸ¤”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am sure that this is a group that cheated the game, to "harvest" the achievements. I'm certain because
                            this percentage has remained fairly static since about 1 or 2 days after the game was released. Also,
                            it would be almost impossible to unlock them all in just 2 days - the game is quite long, and the extras
                            are hard to get to.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So people cheated - but it's not a big deal. They can enjoy the game however they like. But it might be a good idea
                            to factor this into your analysis.
                        </p>

                    <div class='image-section'>

                            }}
                            <div class='image-caption'>
                                Percentage of achievements unlocked for all players

                        </div>

                </div>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I realised that my game is too damn hard!
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we remove both those that cheated and those who couldn't run the game from the stats, we end up with the following:
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Start a new game</td>
                            <td>100%</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Start level 7</td>
                            <td>2.4%</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Start level 13</td>
                            <td>0.32%</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Start level 19</td>
                            <td>0.48%</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Finish the game</td>
                            <td>0%</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>
                    Welp, looks like my game was way too hard (or doesn't seem worth trying) for most players.
                    For my next game I'll make sure to get a variety of players to test it to ensure it's balanced, as it feels
                    like I wasted a lot of time in making the later levels.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    There's lots of insights you can gain from achievements if you put them in interesting places throughout your game.
                    From how players are progressing in the game to how much a certain feature is used; there's a lot of room
                    for analysis. And they're super easy to add to your game to boot!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So next time you release a game on steam, make sure to think about how you can gain insights from your
                    achievements after launch. It's kind of a win win, since there are players out there who value achievements
                    quite highly, and you get the analytics as a bonus.
