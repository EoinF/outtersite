                    <h2>Initial Prototype</h2>
                    <p>
                        What originally started as a birthday present to my girlfriend has evolved into a
                        fully-fledged app. She enjoys solving jigsaw puzzles so I decided to make a little app
                        for creating and solving your own jigsaw puzzles.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class='text-image-group'>
                    <div class='text-section'>
                        <p>
                            The initial idea for the game was to allow templates to be uploaded, from which the puzzle
                            pieces would be extracted. Then a background image could be chosen to be paired with that template,
                            either from a list of predefined backgrounds or one provided by the player.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I completed a little prototype that reads in a template image and splits it up
                            into individual puzzle pieces.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I used a flood fill algorithm to discover all the pixels in each puzzle piece and then
                            created a new texture for each piece.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then I assigned a random colour to each piece to show that they have been separated into
                            individual pieces.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="image-section">
                        {{>image-with-caption
                            imgSrc="/assets/jiggen/screenshot3.png"
                            captionText="An early prototype"
                        }}
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Play on any device</h2>
                </div>
                <div class='text-image-group'>
                    <div class='text-section'>
                        <p>
                            After completing the first prototype I felt there was some promise, so I did a bit of research.
                            I looked for existing jigsaw puzzle websites and found that none of them properly supported
                            mobile devices and some of them didn't even support touch controls.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To me, this seems like a crucial feature for a puzzle game. Being able to play on your phone or tablet 
                            while on the train or during a long flight. Not to mention that it's more natural to use touch controls
                            for this kind of game instead of a mouse.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="image-section">
                        {{>image-with-caption
                            imgSrc="/assets/jiggen/screenshot6.png"
                            captionText="Save custom puzzles to your device"
                        }}
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Create your own puzzles</h2>
                </div>
                <div class='text-image-group'>

                        <p>
                            I wanted to provide useful customization options, but not so complicated that it would overwhelm
                            the player. Jiggen has a screen where you just choose a template and a background, and then go right
                            into solving the puzzle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Images can be uploaded via your phone, or even linked from other websites. I avoid
                            data privacy and GDPR issues by never saving these images.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They are only ever accessed from the user's browser and never actually leave the device.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Background images are also be provided by the app so you don't always have to source your 
                            own images.
                        </p>
